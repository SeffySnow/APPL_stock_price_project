This repository contains a Quarto-powered analysis assessing how recent U.S. tariff announcements affected Apple Inc.’s share value. By combining historical stock data with key news events, we explore price movements and trading volume fluctuations surrounding major policy changes in late 2024 and early 2025.


# Overview
Apple Inc. (AAPL) is one of the largest publicly traded companies in the world. Even small fluctuations in its share price can translate to billions of dollars in market capitalization. This project investigates how three significant U.S. events—from the 2024 presidential election to the imposition of a 25% tariff on certain North American imports—corresponded to shifts in Apple’s stock price and trading volume.

Key questions addressed:

How did Apple’s stock price react immediately after each news event?

Were there noticeable changes in trading volume around tariff announcements?


## Results

**Price Reaction** :

* AAPL’s closing price exhibited a noticeable decline within two trading days of the February 1, 2025 tariff announcement.



**Volume Spikes**:

* Trading volume jumped on the day of the tariff announcement, suggesting increased investor activity.


**Insights & Implications**:

* Tariff announcements can trigger swift sell-offs in large-cap tech stocks. Short-term traders and risk managers should monitor policy calendars for similar events.
* Decreasing price coupled with rising volume suggests that many investors are offloading shares immediately after a policy change.
* The combined use of time-series and event-based analysis provides a replicable framework for investigating policy impacts on other equities.
